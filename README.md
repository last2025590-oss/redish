## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
# Optional: For production conversation mode
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

### 3. Supabase Setup
1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Run the migration file in the SQL editor (copy the entire contents):
   ```sql
   -- Copy contents from supabase/migrations/20250919030155_soft_grove.sql
   ```
3. Update your `.env` with the project URL and anon key
4. Verify both `posts` and `analytics` tables are created with proper RLS policies

### 4. Start Development Server
```bash
expo start
```

### 5. Testing the App
```bash
# Test on different platforms
expo start --web      # Web browser
expo start --ios      # iOS simulator  
expo start --android  # Android emulator
```
